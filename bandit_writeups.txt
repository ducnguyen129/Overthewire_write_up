level 4: 
+ "ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"
+ file have password is in inhere directory so using cd command to goto inhere directory
+ After change dir from ~ to inhere, it have 10 file and there is only one file is readable and it is also password
--> we can using these way to have password
way 1: using bruteforce way by cat all file 
way 2: using command find: "find -type f | xargs file" or "find . -type f -exec file {} +"

+ pass: 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw

level 5: 
+ "ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"
+ In this level, we have to find a file with these conditions: human-readable,1033 bytes in size,not executable
+ So we using find command and then adding these conditions to command 
--> find . -type f ! -executable -readable -size 1033c
+ then when access to that directory that have a file with password using that command again and then cat it

+ pass: HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG

level 6:
+ "ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"
+ like level 5, in this level we have to find a file with these conditions: 
-owned by user bandit7
-owned by group bandit6
-33 bytes in size
--> using command in level 5 but change . (present working directory) to / (root directory) 
+ file have password : /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

+ pass: morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj

level 7:
+ "ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"
+ password in file data.txt but next to the word "millionth" 
--> cat data file with grep command
==> cat data.txt | grep "millionth"

+ pass:dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc

level 8:
+ "ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"
+ In this level, we have to print a line occur only once 
--> sort this file and then cat the unique line 
==> sort data.txt | uniq -u 

pass: 4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM

level 9: 
+ "ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"
+ in this level we can't using cat command because of binary find so we using strings instead and then grep a string have '=' 
==> strings data.txt | grep = 

+ pass: FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey

level 10:
+ "ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"
+ In this level, password is encoded by base64 
--> just strings it (not cat) and then decode (to decode base64, we using base64 -d command with d is mean decode)
==> strings data.txt | base64 -d

+ pass: dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr

level 11: 
+ "ssh bandit11@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"
+  Like the previous level, password has been encoded by ROT13 so we need to decode it
but unfortunerly, we don't have rot13 decode command so we use "tr" (translate) instead
+ if you don't know how ROT13 works, you can read this table: 

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D E F G H I J K L M
--> each character in alphabet will shift 13 step (ex: 'A' = 0 -> 'N' = 13) and similar to lowercase
so we have to translate plain character(A-Z,a-z) to new chatacter according to ROT13 encrypt technique(N-ZA-M,n-za-m) 

+ pass: 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4

level 12: 
+ "ssh bandit12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"
+ In this level, password still in data.txt file but it is a hex dump file now 
First using mktemp -d to create a temporary working directory ensures safe manipulation of unknown files.
The provided data.txt is a hex dump, not raw binary. By inspecting the magic bytes (1f 8b), we identify gzip compression.
The hex dump is converted back to binary using xxd -r.
The resulting file is recursively analyzed using file, revealing multiple layers of compression: gzip → bzip2 → tar archive.
Each layer is decompressed using the appropriate tool until the final ASCII text file is obtained
--> cat it and receive password

+ pass: FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn

level 13: 
+ "ssh bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"
+  This time, we don't have to find the password but we have to using ssh to login bandit14
First, cat the file sshkey.private and copy all content then logout and add that content to a .key file 
then because only host(bandit14) can open so we make that file only for host(600)
Finally using the ssh to login bandit 14

level 14: 
+ In this level we get password by submit the password of current level (bandit13 -> bandit14)
So just go back to level13 -> level14 and cat the file :  /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14  to get password and then using netcat 
and get the password
hint: nc host port

pass: 8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo

level 15:
+ In this level, we need to using the password of bandit14 and connect with localhost and port 30001
this level have an suggest: Getting “DONE”, “RENEGOTIATING” or “KEYUPDATE”? Read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage.
the CONNECT COMMANDS related to s_client command (using man s_client to know) then just connect by using openssl s_client
and connect with localhost:30001 and paste password from level14 and pass
hint: openssl s_client -connect IP_host:port

+ pass: kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx

level 16: 
+ Remember the key when using openssl s_client command ? and apply with what you know in level 13 to access to bandit 16
OK back to this challenge, we have to connect with localhost with port in range 31000 to 32000 and paste the password from 
previous level to pass 
+ but the previous command openssl s_client can using with 1 port only so wwe have to using nmap to scan what ports are available
then using openssl s_client and connect with it 

hint: nmap -p <port-range> IP_host, ncat --ssl IP_host:port
ports: 31790, 31518

level 17:
+ Using RSA code from level 16 to login to bandit 17
+ there are 2 files password.new and password.old, and you have to compare these two file to get password 
hint : diff file1 file2 

pass: x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO

level 18: 
+ If you pass level 17 and try to login to bandit18, you will auto logout but 
the thing is we need to read the readme file to see password so that you can login to bandit18
and adding "cat readme" command

pass: cGWpMaKXVwDUNgPAVJbWYuGHVn9zl3j8

level 19: 
+ "ssh bandit19@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" 
+ While exploring the home directory, we find an interesting file:
" -rwsr-x--- 1 bandit20 bandit19 14884 Oct 14 09:26 bandit20-do"
This file is owned by user bandit20 and has an unusual permission: s instead of x in the user execute bit.
The s indicates the setuid (Set User ID) permission.
When a binary with setuid is executed, it runs with the privileges of its owner, not the user who launched it.
So in this case: 
     + We need to do something to execute that file although we are bandit 19 user
     + Executing bandit20-do causes the process to run with bandit20 privileges
-> This allows bandit19 to execute commands as bandit20 without knowing the password, but only through the logic implemented in the binary.

level 20: 
+ "ssh bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"
if you try to execute the suconnect file, you will receive this message:
"  This program will connect to the given port on localhost using TCP.
 If it receives the correct password from the other side, the next password is transmitted back."
-> its mean you need to connect with port and using TCP
First, i using nmap to show which ports are busy
Then, I will create a server by using netcat (hint: nc -l -p port) (l is mean listen and p is port)
and make it run in background. The suconnect file will connect to that server and send the bandit20 password to it

level 21: 
+ "ssh bandit21@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"
In this task, you need to see what command is running in /etc/cron.d/
-> cd to  /etc/cron.d/
Then, when you ls this file, you will see a file name "cronjob_bandit22"
cat it and you know that this file execute bash script everytime
cat that .sh file and surprise, everytime this script execute, it save to "/tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv"
=> just cat this file and you receive password

level 22: 
+ "ssh bandit22@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"
+ continue using the way we solve level 21, we go to the /etc/cron.d and cat the file cronjob_bandit23
+ now, cat the .sh file and this is what is it
